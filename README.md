## Styling with Vanilla CSS

- In _index.css_ file, we can write CSS code.
- For React apps created with **Vite**, we have _main.jsx_ file and we can import the _index.css_ there.

### Splitting CSS Code Across Multiple Files

- We can create _Header.css_ file right beside the _Header.jsx_ file.
- Grab all the CSS code that are related to the _Header.jsx_ component from _index.css_ file into this _Header.css_ file.
- Then import this _Header.css_ file from inside the _Header.jsx_ file.
- The result should be the same as writing all CSS code inside the _index.css_ file.
